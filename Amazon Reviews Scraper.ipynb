      "Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 8 October 2022Size name: 128GBColour: GraphiteVerified Purchase\n",
      "Intro note: I am a die hard android fan who jumped ship to iOS for 1 reason: BoredomNo matter what phone I used, interface of android devices was dependent on skins and I needed a break from the common style and not get used to something so easily. Or not get bored in a week of setting up the device which has happened frequently in android that you don‚Äôt get that new phone feeling at all.Experience:Had to learn from scratch on how to use an iPhone and get used to iOS. Been 2 months and it‚Äôs safe to say that I am still getting used to an iOS and iPhone.Right from transferring data to setting up the device needed another device with YouTube to do it the right way. I never had the need for this for so many years. But what is intriguing is having spent a lakh I‚Äôm inclined to the 14 series so much so that I wasn‚Äôt thinking straight in terms of the upgrade or exchange cost due to the FOMO or the advertisement from apple on the 14 pro although it‚Äôs not that different. What can one expect? A reliable device that takes getting used to if your moving across platforms. Sold build quality that gives a premium look and that something one can expect from an expensive product such as this.Performance: The device hasn‚Äôt slowed down even for once with 20apps running in the background so getting used to the Multi tasking device.Camera: I had pixel 2XL in the past so that had a unique USP of brining out the best in everything pic that was clicked with portrait mode being the best of all the features. With iPhone 13 Pro it feels like they wanted to try the same trick, give the users the best among whatever is advertised. The pixel had more saturated images which helped in some situations and iPhone 13 Pro gives the best of both worlds with the image outcome choice.Display: I have used 120hz refresh rate before moving to iPhone 13 Pro and that‚Äôs something people would appreciate and going back to 60hz would surely make it difficult and I enjoy the feel and feedback every moment while using multiple apps.Battery performance: This was my only primary reason for switching from android to iPhone. Just to add a reference this purchase was made in AUG 2022 where I had the choice of Samsung Flagships and the choice of oneplus, google etc. No comments on the performance side of things on the android devices because most devices were running SD 8 Gen 1 and it was easy to say that androids were going on the right path in not slowing down anytime soon and became better than their predecessors. So what was the point in moving out of Android? Inconsistent battery life across all devices because I was using pixel 2 XL and then moved to Samsung s20fe which all had similar issues, unusual battery drain and unexplained standby time‚Äôs reduction despite having location services off, uninstalling unused apps and so many tweaking. If your someone who tweaks the settings a lot and still end up with not so great battery life then it‚Äôs time to switch my friend. Apple just didn‚Äôt promise more than average battery life, it‚Äôs exceptional and happy to say that regardless of the device performance or cameras or anything that one would consider I just would stick on until I get this feature on android. Apple have been notorious for sending updates to reduce the battery life so until something like that happens, it‚Äôs a worthwhile sticking on.Haptics: The haptics or vibration motor is something I stopped turning on in the android device due to excessive battery consumption and I now need not worry because the battery doesn‚Äôt die on me that easily. But special call-out to scrolling in some apps where you can literally feel the smallest scroll through the feedback given by the haptic motor. I will miss this if I had to go back to Android in the future.Overall experience: Going with the simple saying ‚ÄúConsistency is the key‚Äù you don‚Äôt want the best of 1 feature and failure at others. The experience most people want to now see is Jack of all even if it‚Äôs the master of none.Outside of this overall experience: You took the plunge, arranged the funds and got the device but it never stops with that. Apple‚Äôs strong push to adapt to it‚Äôs ecosystem is felt every single day where I‚Äôm contemplating getting a series 7 smart watch and the AirPods Pro already even though it‚Äôs not needed.Workaround: Got my partner a oneplus 10T with oneplus buds pro and nord smartwatch all under 60K price tag and she‚Äôs been a happy customer ever since. It‚Äôs scary how much one ends up spending at the end of the day for a decent device. Hopefully I can hold on to this device for 3 years so financially the numbers add up and I don‚Äôt regret.\n",

      "I have had a hard time choosing between this  and the 14 pro. But decided to listen to my brains than my heart this time and I made the right decision. I did check out the 14 pro max and have to say, the dynamic island intrigued me at first but was not really that big a deal and it‚Äôs a glorified gimmick you would easily forget and has no real value to it at all. The cameras in the 14 pro is a notch above but for the price it comes in, it‚Äôs really not worth it. In every other aspect, one simply cannot go wrong with the 13 pro. It‚Äôs essentially the same phone, for all practical purposes. Go for the 13 pro if you too find yourself torn between the 13 pro and the 14 pro.Fabulous same day delivery by Amazon, which is one of the reasons that makes them the best e-commerce website in the country.\n",
